## What's IBV?
Visit <a href="https://bundibundi.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinity Blade Viewer</a>
You can explore a few Infinity Blade Maps.
It's made with the help of Deepseek (LLM) and Babylon.js (before I was using CesiumJS).

Other maps are from the Infinityblade Unreal Engine Plugins (Infinity Blade Content Packs). You can't install them through the offical plugin store anymore, you need to manually download and install them.

I've exported the blender maps to .glb files. If they were too big for github I've shrunk the size / compressed them here: https://convert3d.org/compress

I had to export some of the Unreal Engine Maps a bit different, in order that Babylon is able to load them in the browser:

To check / view the .glb files I've used: https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/

I've exported the UE maps just like shown in this video:
