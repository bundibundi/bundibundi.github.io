# Infinity Blade Viewer 
## goals:
- [ ] Viewer works with a .glb map file exported from the throne from 
huells' blender maps from IB1 & IB2. The map has to load from the website directly, no uploads required.

- [ ] Export the other maps with huells' blender files to .glb format and upload to Infinity Blade Viewer and test of maps successful.
- [ ] Think of what maps to "rebuild" in blender myself. Then try to "rebuild". If successful upload and test map/maps. 
- [ ] Upload more stuff, if possible, like character models from extracted assets.
- [ ] Export / Convert old Infinity Blade Collection maps, to .glb format. If possible upload and test maps.

      The files are still somewhere on the internet. A guy has reuploaded them to github. Would probably find it again if needed.
- [ ] Buy domain when I've decided on a cool domain name.
- [ ] Buy hosting or host them myself or stick to github. Idk if github is good for hosting this website.
