# Infinity Blade Viewer 
goal:
[ ]Viewer works with a .glb map file exported from the throne from 
huells' blender maps from IB1 & IB2. The map has to load from the website directly, no uploads required.

[ ]Export the other maps with huells' blender files to .glb format and upload to Infinity Blade Viewer and test of maps successful.
[ ]Think of what maps to "rebuild" in blender myself. Then try to "rebuild". If successful upload this map/maps. 
[ ]Upload more stuff, if possible, like character models from extracted assets.
