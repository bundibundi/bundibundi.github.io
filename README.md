# Infinity Blade Viewer 
## What's IBV?
Visit <a href="https://bundibundi.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinity Blade Viewer</a>
You can explore a few Infinity Blade Maps.
It's made with the help of Deepseek (LLM) and Babylon.js (before I was using CesiumJS).

Other maps are from the Infinityblade Unreal Engine Plugins (Infinity Blade Content Packs). You can't install them through the offical plugin store anymore, you need to manually download and install them.

I've exported the blender maps to .glb files. If they were too big for github I've shrunk the size / compressed them here: https://convert3d.org/compress

To check / view the .glb files I've used: https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/

I've exported the UE maps just like shown in this video:

Thanks Deepseek for the coding and reading my bad prompts.

## Controls:
- moving around with WASD
- faster zoom in and out with mouse wheel
- left click anywhere, then use mouse to look around (press ESC to see you mouse again)
- orientation can be off, just press spacebar to readjust and use JKIL for looking around up, down, left, right only in one direction

## problems / bugs / challenges
- lighting, too dark at the moment
- I can't code XD. I can only run code from AI's like Deekseek, Chatgpt and Grok but I don't understand the "why" if something doesn't work.
- Rotation / orientation is wrong sometimes. Maybe i can turn/lock the orientation so that movement is just like "noclip" in a videogame or something, so no rotation.

## goals:
- [x] Viewer works with a .glb map file exported from the throne from 
huells' blender maps from IB1 & IB2. The map has to load from the website directly, no uploads required.
(I've used throne room, removed the white cube in blender, exported to glb file. Then made deepseek AI code me a map viewer + controls from scratch.)
- [ ] Fix the problems in problems / bugs / challenges section.
- [ ] Export the other maps with huells' blender files to .glb format and upload to Infinity Blade Viewer and test of maps successful.
- [ ] Think of what maps to "rebuild" in blender myself. Then try to "rebuild". If successful upload and test map/maps. 
- [ ] Upload more stuff, if possible, like character models from extracted assets.
- [ ] Export / Convert old Infinity Blade Collection maps, to .glb format. If possible upload and test maps.

      The files are still somewhere on the internet. A guy has reuploaded them to github. Would probably find it again if needed.
- [ ] Buy domain when I've decided on a cool domain name.
- [ ] Buy webhosting or host the website myself or stick with github. Idk if github is good for hosting this website. I have to research.
